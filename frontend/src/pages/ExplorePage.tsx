            Introduction
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Hello, Iâ€™m Nafisat Muhammadâ€”an online investor passionate about
            teaching people how to make money using just their smartphones.
            Today, Iâ€™m excited to introduce you to the Pdes platform, an
            innovative investment tool designed to help you earn regardless of
            the amount you invest.

        {/* Why Choose Pdes Section */}

            Why Choose Pdes?
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Pdes is a fully registered investment platform that takes your
            security seriously. With a robust email verification process, it
            ensures that every user is genuine and that your funds are safe and
            secure. This verification not only protects your investment but also
            underscores the platform's trustworthiness.

            Dynamic Investment Rates
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            One of the most impressive aspects of Pdes is how your earnings can
            grow over time. Even if two investors start at the same time, the
            differences in their earnings over 30, 60, or 90 days can be
            significant. Early investors, even with deposits as modest as 10,000
            or 50,000 NGN, can see substantial returns as their earnings
            compound.
          </p>
          <p>
            Itâ€™s important to maintain only one account per userâ€”this helps
            ensure fairness and prevents any restrictions that might arise from
            multiple accounts.

              <strong>Higher Rewards:</strong> A larger first deposit unlocks

              <strong>Enhanced Profits:</strong> More capital means higher
              profits early on, keeping you motivated and allowing you to

          <p>
            When inviting new members to join Pdes, I encourage them to deposit
            a higher amount to maximize both their rewards and your overall team
            benefits.
